Principle 2: Quality Is In The Eyes of The Beholer

原则2: 质量 是情人眼里出西施

There is no one definiton os software quality. To developers, it might be an elegant design or legant code. To users who wor in stress environments, it might be response time or high capacity. For cost-sensitive projects, i might be low development cost. For some customers, it might be satisfying all their perceived and not-yet-perceived needs. The dilemma is that these may not be all compatible. Optimizing one person's quality might be detrimental to another's.(This is Weinberg's "Political Dilemma" principle.) A project must decide on its priorities and articulate them to all parties. 

软件质量没有一个明确定义. 对于开发者来说,它可能是一个精巧的设计或代码. 对于需求严格的用户来说, 它可能是响应时间或者高容量. 对于代价敏感的项目来说, 它可能是低廉的开发成本. 对于普通用户来说, 它可以满足他们已知和未知的需求. 困境是:这些视角不能同时被满足. 在一个视角下的最优化质量, 对另外一个视角可能是危害.(这就是WeinBerg提出的"政治困境"原则.) **工程必须明确它的优先级, 并周知所有的参与者.**
